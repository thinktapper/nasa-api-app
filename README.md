## How It's Made:

ðŸ•¹ **Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The images and descriptions are pulled from the NASA APOD API. Intro thumbnail image is pulled using an randomly generated date automatically. Dates generated by clicking the "Blast Off" button under the <a href="#">Random</a> tab range from 1970 â†’ present day.
*(Note: not all dates have entries, especially < 1990's)*

## Lessons Learned:

ðŸš€ I refined my API skills by fetching data and elegantly appending multiple parts of it to the DOM. I also got practical experience working with date manipulation in JavaScript by ensuring that dates generated randomly are properly formatted to interact with NASA's API.
